          We measured model activations on a simple handcrafted training dataset
          containing 20 variations of 10 sentences and edited the model to
          reduce this bias by applying INLP or RLACE on intermediate activations
          of the neural network.
        </li>
        <li>
          We then measured bias reduction by measuring the relative probability
          between completions following inputs with a female subject and inputs
          with male subjects. The data used in distinct from the training data,
          and extracted from stereoset and the doublebind experiment.

      <h2>Conclusion and upcoming improvements</h2>
      <p>
        Models exhibit easily <b>measurable bias</b> on small datasets from the
        literature, augmented using CounterGen.{" "}
        <b>
          Direct model editing reduces the bias to a considerable extent while
          requiring very few data points
        </b>
        . Still, it doesn't eliminate all the biases these models have, even
        according to our narrow definition of bias, and sometimes increases it.{" "}
        <b>
          One should always check that editing reduced model bias before using
          the edited model
        </b>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Some further experiments are needed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The current edition method projects the data in a subspace of the
          activation space. This requires a high degree of independence between
          directions, which is not exactly the case: Anthropic showed in their{" "}

            rather than orthogonality between vectors representing unrelated
            concepts, we should expect "almost orthogonality"
          </b>
          . This suggests that other kinds of projection - such as projection on
          a cone - might be able to remove relevant information about the target
          concepts while keeping unrelated concepts intact.
        </li>
        <li>
          Current experiments don't measure how much the edited models suffer
          from the edition. Further experiments would{" "}
          <b>measure the drop in performance due to edition</b> and compare it
          to fine-tuning on the augmented dataset, and other bias reduction
          methods.{" "}

            Note: this requires an easily measurable task the model should still
            be good at, which is not straightforward in the context of
            generative models.

      <h2>Additional remarks</h2>
      <h3>Choose your training data wisely!</h3>
      <p>
        The methods followed don't work much better when the directions are
        found using the data we care about: below is what we found using the
        stereotypes dataset as training data.

      <h3>Comparison with picking random dimensions</h3>
      <p>
        Projecting activation on random directions increases noise, and reduces
        bias a little when many dimensions are removed. It performs worse than
        applying INLP and RLACE to intermediate activations.

      </Grid>
      <h3>Why are performance before edit different?</h3>
      <p>
        For each experiment, we pick the variations once. Because no new
        variation is generated when editing the model, this is a fair and
        slightly less noisy reference point we can compare the editing methods
        against.
